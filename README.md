# Predicting-Diabetes-Risks-A-machine-learning-approach-using-Decision-trees-and-Random-Forests

# Overview
This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset containing various medical measurements, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more, we developed models using decision trees and random forests to accurately determine the presence or absence of diabetes.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of anonymized medical data from individuals, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, age, and more. The target variable is the presence or absence of diabetes, where 1 represents the presence and 0 represents the absence of diabetes.

# Methods Used
- Data exploration and preprocessing: The dataset was explored to gain insights into the features and identify any missing or inconsistent data. Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and scaling the features were performed.
- Model development: Decision tree and random forest classifiers were trained on the preprocessed data to predict diabetes risk. Multiple hyperparameters were tuned to optimize model performance.
- Evaluation: The models were evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric to measure their predictive power. Additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also considered.

# Key Findings
- Glucose levels, BMI, age, and insulin levels were identified as the most important features for predicting diabetes risk. These findings align with existing medical knowledge and provide valuable insights into risk factors.
- The decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 72% on the testing data, while the random forest classifier achieved an accuracy of 76%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of both models in predicting diabetes risk.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of machine learning in predicting diabetes risk based on medical measurements. By applying decision tree and random forest models, we achieved accurate predictions, enabling early identification of individuals at risk of diabetes. This project contributes to ongoing efforts in healthcare innovation and emphasizes the importance of data-driven approaches in disease prevention and management.

# Future Steps
- Further refinement of the models: Fine-tuning of hyperparameters and exploration of alternative algorithms could potentially improve model performance.
- Integration into healthcare systems: Collaboration with healthcare professionals and validation studies would be necessary before deploying the models in real-world clinical settings.
- Expansion of feature set: Exploring additional relevant features, such as genetic information or lifestyle factors, could enhance the predictive ability of the models.
